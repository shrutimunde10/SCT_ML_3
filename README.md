# SCT_ML_3
This project implements an SVM model to classify cats and dogs using HOG features. Images are preprocessed (grayscale, resized to 128x128), and HOG features are extracted. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model achieves predictions with high accuracy. The script includes a function to predict new images.
